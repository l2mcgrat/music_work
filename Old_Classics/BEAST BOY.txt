Beast Boy

(chorus)
Yeah I’m flexin’.  I’m a beast BOY
These hoes trippin, they like, what boy?
These haters talkin’ We don’t need noise 
Keep talkin all that shit, you’ll be destroyed

I think I’m gettin sick, it’s my rhymes

I’m gettin sicker, gettin slicker, gettin bigger,
I’m poppin on these charts, no guns on my trigger-

I’m still flexing like a beast, on top.  No luck  BOYYY

These haters talkin’ We don’t need noise 
Keep talkin all that shit, you’ll be destroyed

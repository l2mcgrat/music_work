Freaks

Either medicated or I meditated   
If its from my foe then you better hate it  
I been elevated on some marijuana
I’d be devistated if I saw its gone so ima
Celebrate it when I buy an O
Forever faded fuck it ima smoke 

Quite persistant with wild vision though you might resist it I’m going hard
Reach the goal don’t mind the distance i’m an iron skillet  tryna fry a bitch and
I am tired of seeing all this hype appearence I don’t mind appearing like a child of bitchin 
Tho im high i’m feeling we need the realness I don’t fucking see it and i’m tired of shitting 

On the mumble rappers they’ll mumble at ya
Im a humble rapper so im humble at ya

Take the series in game 6
Reload see him and aim quick
Hunting game is so dangerous 
Insane how does his brain tick
Haneous with his tactics
Bain dismayed going Bat-Shit
Fake and gay with is actions 
Prey claimed with contraptions 

SAW Three with the hard read 
Hardly timing it tardy
Card me im a red bull
Im fired up like Cardi

Marti cause i’m fly 
High cause I like to party
Go hard until I die
Ending just like it started

Parted with my past
but alas im still haunted
Claimed perspective with grass 
but forget shit fuck I ain’t flawless

Causing problems in class
I ain’t got a problem with that
Cause memorizing this fact
ain’t a step on my legit path

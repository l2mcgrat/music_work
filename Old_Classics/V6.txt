Verse 6

Sixth verse theres reverb sixth day from rehab
To much to rehearse to little to research
Think first but be heard be confident and feel that you know shit so speak up so bosses will theater 
When giving promotions you know its your time 
When you brought up those profits yourself all for wine 
Cause getting a raise is our purpose these days
Get a white picket fence and a mortgage your fine 
Else your a freak with no kids when deceased 
These pressures are pushing us past our own peaks
Were mice in a maze and were chasing this cheeses
Its amazing together, the moon we can reach

Cole’s at the core of the rappers for peace
Chance breads a chance for land that is free
Don’t mistake his mixtapes for simple ol track
The labels foundation will crickle or crack
Cause free musics better if theres equal production
But that’s a corporations niche its motor function
It specializes in outputing shit that makes money
Cole let Nas down cause of a track that said nothing
Jay and Nas were rivals cause of different believes 
Jay was for survival while Nas was for the streets
Cole was always bout the streets and tryna make a message into music so the youth got perspective as he stressed it

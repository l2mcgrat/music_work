Happens

Started off me and my mom
Being strong feeling wronged
By people and the system 
No cure with words of wisdom
Its a situation of long drawn out struggles we hussled
But got through with huddles, intellegence and cuddles
Dad left early in childhood he hurt me
Tryna be a writer look at me being wordy
Every sentence I write sentence me to be hurting
And I ask if its worth it my stress is distrubing 
But success is in sight so im working my wording
Keep focused feel hopeless like im born with a curse
No child support a while before things got worse
Me a pre teen I paniced when my mom went manic
She was frantic to move and it happened no planning
Who knew in the future we'd improve a better place
But hell we did move through couldn't choose for heaven sakes
Every challenge we managed in endurance elevate
And with time she find the right guy, a better mate
Name was Risto better fit though I gave him resistance
Now id travel back in time and slap myself shitless
Cause he saved us without him I doubt id be gifted
With the chance of lifetime so I won't dismiss it
A nanotechnologist u know who the prophet is
Ima change up technologies ain't no cog that is stoppin this
Its entropy my enemy and my work is exhausting
This system of pistons pressed with energy is costing
My sanity, my ego brings vanity ive lost it
Disconnected with family when tragedy occured
Grandpa passed away then the panicing emerged
He raised me thought me truths now what am I supposed to do
Grandma got cancer, god is cruel my point of view
She told me be positive so il trust and acknowledge it
Shes fighting for life with help from oncologist
So much strength in her veins its through pain that she fostered it 
I should be more supportive so my problems im pausin it
So much greed for the weed but right now I am off of it
I ride with meditation, the long term solution to medication
Devistating how some rely on it day to day shit
Way to waste it, try some patience why u waiting
Why am I hating, on myself, im way to wasted
Way to waste it, try some patience why u latent

Why's he faken, guy is baken
Tryna be wise his mind is vacent
Tryna seem kind with lively statements
Whens he taking meditations
Whens he patient, whens he pay shit
And most of all just when'll he face it
A mind of its kind won't shine erased
You can rise or be high so why you wasted

SMASH V(31-34)  Pracice 

Fire it up
4 stock on them green greens
High as fuck on that leafly 
High as fuck on that threepeat
How is he to be beat
Cheats couldn’t crease me 
Sheik couldn’t sneak me
Pichu on the mean beat
Beat you on the battlefield
You can’t even see me
Tho I wonder how you feel 
you can’t even feel me 
I can’t fathom how you deal
Losses when my tiers weak
Don’t mean to heat seek

I ain’t tryna attack you man 
Matter fact I like you man
Matter fact your skills are rather wack did you know that you can improve them with some practice makes movements reinact it when works and when it doesn’t then you dump it with your maxi pads

Happy dance for a period when you win some you’ll be happy then

Jokes bitch
Oh you lost because your nose itches 
Try shutting the fuck up
Maybe then you’ll be focused
Il ain’t gonna stop man
Im off it and your 4 stocked
Your bitch here to Watchmen
She lioness im roarshock
Got more pop
Names flavor like don’t stop
Playing what im supposed to
Maybe il sign your poster
Maybe you should wait 
until im lazy as a post-doc
Player takes the bait and while
educated and il roast ya

While hella faded I rose up
Medicated I broke the rules 
Dedicated boy you know what
Skill crafting I overdue
Im still faster and theres no one who
Can win backwards not playing hard 
With a handicap going Neymar 
Cause im built a skill engrainer
You still a player hater 
who tryna gain this paper

Now ima swerve right to the slow lane 
Give you Canon-dork but theres no takes
Ima make a film, you gone slip tho
This is smash brawl, im a scitzo

Im a rando, fuck all trades
This is economics cause I got paid
To just appear kept it off stage
I still got the money, been a long day

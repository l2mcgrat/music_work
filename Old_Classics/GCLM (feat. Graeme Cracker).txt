GCLM (feat. Graeme Cracker)

Welcome to the loo crew you shoud fucking do me 
Wish I fucking knew you, wish you fucking knew me 
Wishing for a new bitch, fishing in a new sea 
Seeing who im cool with, hope she got a few tree’s 

oh dang, winter and cold things, snow bank’s, youll get pushed in one - no thanks, christmas trees, so dank
i got mary jane with me under the missle toe, if youve been missing this youve been missing out, liam mcgrath - unpredictable

Met a little mistress she had me feeling different 
Put me in the present baby I was feeling gifted 
She was fucking cole though I don’t fucking miss it 
Think I miss the hole though I left a month from christmas 

alright liam mcgrath let me block copolymer the flow, knock em out like dominoes, get all of the hot girls hollerin, is that not a hard flow to follow bro? i know you smash it like olimar, until the molecules down to monomer, the other rappers don’t want it with us, no use in trying it, we can take all of em

life is all bout your enviroment cause the pioneers yeah you follow em,
so im grinding hard till my time is up till retirement when I follow up
From my first single to financial freedom till im worth millions I start to meet up
With born legends I try to been em while I reach for stars so my hearts beating 

and it’s hard to beat when it’s 180 bpm that your heart is beating, partially vegan, sparking a beacon, sending the smoke signal, start to get tweaking, you’ll be seeing stars when we free these bars, me and liam we could be on mars, now that is freedom, keys open doors and never finish your water, nano of the above is a better name than nanoconda

Theres a patch of parrots we all just stare at pandimonium can’t handle all em
from somalia the life of a parrot or pirate is a lonely ship, holy shit
you either show me shit or owe me shit my showman ship is holy shit
know we get soo sea sick, cosy shit, don’t need it, kobe shit, 

and you know me smoke weed then no dreaming don’t sleep in only GET
REM once a week hard being fun and weak or be lit 
ovo know me yo don’t be shit feel for me don’t need no phony shit care for me charity but don’t need no Kony shit

alright that flow we spit is over with 
all night all day and always forever,
fall right into the long december,
cold weather but i like snow better,

I should know better but she’s more wetter 
I got bad grammer but a dope sweater
from a dope granny while im so whiny 
its a sick family so my souls smiling

i could not go get a cold in hawaii,
i wasnt getting high but following through,
im talking to you, and looking through you, im going to ottawa so this is my final hollerin boo,
youve never been where i been, honolulu, waterloo too, prolly on the moon soon, badadoodoo

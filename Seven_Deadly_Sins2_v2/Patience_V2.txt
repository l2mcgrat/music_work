I am not one to fight
I am smart I am kind 
I'm the spark in the night 
I am dark I am light
I am fearful of thoughts
That make me revered 
I am a vagabond
When I want I'm revealed
I appear place to place
No family to claim
Everyone wants a piece
All I want is peace
So when I'm alone 
These thoughts I release
I'm not one to fight 
I'm not one to please
My ego is killed 
I'm not one to heal
I'm dying inside 
What I ought to feel
I work hard for now
I wait till I lose 
I shine bright for now
Than burn all my fuel

I made it past 27 tryna send a message
Spend time alive to find all your blessings
Some are deceitful some are oppressive
But some lift you up if they see your regressing
So don't give up, take the pain as a lesson
Everyone you lift up, is a gain to your essence
People see thru the lies, people make their impression
What's the point in dying tryna seem so impressive
What's the point in dying tryna seem so impressive
What's the point in dying tryna seem so impressive
What's the point in dying tryna seem so impressive
What's the point in dying tryna seem so impressive

I am not one to fight
I am smart I am kind 
I'm the spark in the night 
I am dark I am light
I am fearful of thoughts
That make me revered 
I am a vagabond
When I want I'm revealed
I appear place to place
No family to claim
Everyone wants a piece
All I want is peace
So when I'm alone 
These thoughts I release
I'm not one to fight 
I'm not one to please
My ego is killed 
I'm not one to heal
I'm dying inside 
What I ought to feel
I work hard for now
I wait till I lose 
I shine bright for now
Than burn all my fuel
I am not one to fight
I am smart I am kind 
I'm the spark in the night 
I am dark I am light
I am fearful of thoughts
That make me revered 
I am a vagabond
When I want I'm revealed

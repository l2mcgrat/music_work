Humility_V2

I have many things to fix
Feels like being Sisyphus 
You can't ever wish of this
Pain it comes with brilliance
Satisfaction come with passion
See creations been unfathomed 
I see genius is in fashion
and I wreak it I'm inactive

I have many things to fix
Feels like being Sisyphus 
You can't ever wish of this
Pain it comes with brilliance
Satisfaction come with passion
See creations been unfathomed 
I see genius is in fashion
and I wreck it I'm inactive

Whatchu talking bout vibe checks
No one inside ya mind yet
Ego keeping them in fear
Peoples thoughts just disappear
Boogieman appear in sight
You don't care if you been right
Want whatchu want and right now
Brave New World we fight power
We just wanted what you worked for
Puter help is how we earn more
Future really seem so bleak
Stats are facts its in our birth score
Algorithm makes me curse less
Algorithm makes her twerk more
Algorithm is a curse yea
Algorithm what we work for
AI taking all the jobs 
Even if its a facade
Degree people are turnt up
Temperature to make us burn up
I was born for a purpose
With the passion just to learn stuff
For the sake of being certain
Or on stage with closed curtains
Humility ya that's my sermon 
God can judge me if i'm worth 
I see no one as below me
Holy water down it holds me 
Praying and what god had told me
I have purpose what he sold me 
I'm attracting peace and hope
I think that's what's really for me

I have many things to fix
Feels like being Sisyphus 
You can't ever wish of this
Pain it comes with brilliance
Satisfaction come with passion
See creations been unfathomed 
I see genius is in fashion
and I wreak it I'm inactive

I have many things to fix
Feels like being Sisyphus 
You can't ever wish of this
Pain it comes with brilliance
Satisfaction come with passion
See creations been unfathomed 
I see genius is in fashion
and I wreck it I'm inactive

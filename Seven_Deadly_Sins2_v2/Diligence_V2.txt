Diligence_V2

To the glory of god, 
I've been told I have hope
Though my story is odd, 
I been pouring my soul
If you look in my eyes, 
I see thru ya lies
I can see ya demise 
and I can cure you with time
Diligence is the benefit 
but I do it for genesis
Emergence of relevance, 
I see thru till the end of it
I'm addicted to drugs, 
this my only impediment 
I'm afflicted with love, 
but I'm open to settling 

Closed doors I don't like that
Fold over I ain't like that
Structure is affected
Functional is perspective
Capability is relative
Reality ain't a sedative
You pretend you relevant
Make it get repetitive
I work hard and fight back
I don't see my mind matched
Solutions I will find that
You should see my mind craft
You should see my code work
Automate a word search
Automating everything
Replicating every brain
I'm out here to take jobs
Please somebody say somn
Please somebody stop me
AI work I copy
I'm a prompting engineer
Tech knowledge I persevere 
Lost job I couldn't fear
Sauced slob when I appear

To the glory of god, 
I've been told I have hope
Though my story is odd, 
I been pouring my soul
If you look in my eyes, 
I see thru ya lies
I can see ya demise 
and I can cure you with time
Diligence is the benefit 
but I do it for genesis
Emergence of relevance, 
I see thru till the end of it
I'm addicted to drugs, 
this my only impediment 
I'm afflicted with love, 
but I'm open to settling 
Once a wise man said
Don't be using for benefit
Cause yo time will end
And you'll end up in hell for it
Guess that statement was right
Wondering just what heaven is
Either facing the light 
Or I'll learn who the devil is

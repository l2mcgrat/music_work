You were with me before three rebirths
Funny its the same way we see this earth
Agree to disagree when yo man been foul
Love gets the best of you, you hand them power

I just want what's best for you bro been thru it
Sucks, its a shane, can't that hoe see thru it
That bitch tried to shade me claiming lust
That bitch don't pass the bar so we ain't even fucked
First girlfriend fucked me up at the end of it
Friends with benefits, that's why I ended it
No more boundaries so it all falls down
Begging to stay I ain't on that route
Everyone after seemingly had to calm down
Suicidal tendencies so who do I call now
Sober issues lately make me focus inward
Overstate the problem I am socially injured
Astral projection, I'm just watching the world spin
Cheating people leaving agony in the whirlwind
All this suffering just to nab me a girlfriend
Working on myself maybe that is the first thing

You were with me before three rebirths
Funny its the same way we see this earth
Agree to disagree when yo man been foul
Love gets the best of you, you hand them power

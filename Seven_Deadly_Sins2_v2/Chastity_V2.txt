You were with me before three rebirths
Funny its the same way we see this earth
Agree to disagree when yo man been foul
Love gets the best of you, you hand them power

I just want what's best for you bro been thru it
Sucks, its a shane, can't that hoe see thru it
That bitch tried to shade me claiming lust
That bitch don't pass the bar so we ain't even fucked
First girlfriend fucked me up at the end of it
Friends with benefits, that's why I ended it
No more boundaries so it all falls down
Begging to stay I ain't on that route
Everyone after seemingly had to calm down
Suicidal tendencies so who do I call now
Sober issues lately make me focus inward
Overstate the problem I am socially injured
Astral projection, I'm just watching the world spin
Cheating people leaving agony in the whirlwind
All this suffering just to nab me a girlfriend
Working on myself maybe that is the first thing

You were with me before three rebirths
Funny its the same way we see this earth
Agree to disagree when yo man been foul
Love gets the best of you, you hand them power

Kill count equals all the hearts that I broke down
I fell out of love and they felt they had no power
Felt it was over like three months prior
But I pushed to the end like the weakest coward
Endless crying intimacy dying
Friends no more infinitely spiraling
Clean breaks weak states no more replays
I don't think I've ever went this fast on the eway
Love lost what's more struggling these days
Holdin back feelings cause I just wanna feel safe
One girls a struggle I made her my chorus
And if u think it's you, least my love ain't porous

You were with me before three rebirths
Funny its the same way we see this earth
Agree to disagree when yo man been foul
Love gets the best of you, you hand them power

You were with me before three rebirths
Funny its the same way we see this earth
Agree to disagree when yo man been foul
Love gets the best of you, you hand them power

You were with me before three rebirths
Funny its the same way we see this earth
Agree to disagree when yo man been foul
Love gets the best of you, you hand them power

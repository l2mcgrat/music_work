Kindness_V2

When with my people I breath kindness, yea
When with my people I keep mindful, yea
No cell phone tone to distract my focus
When with my people I'm alive I feel hopeful
Listen and give I don't mind it, yea
They always give back, my findings, yea
People in tears when I was dying, yea
Missing the years when I was thriving, yea

They always there and just a call away
Believing in spirits with bond thru space
We all interconnected thru being and essence
World wide friends no feelings in question
Changed minds save lives ain't got to say why
Inefficient minutes don't exist so we save time

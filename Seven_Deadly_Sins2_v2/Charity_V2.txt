I've given everything to this world
It only gives back with a certain herd
We stick together mostly cause we need to
As a tool, everyone else see's you
Sucks when you see through manipulation
Know that its happening and have to fake it
Agreeableness is a death by patience
We really due for some reparations 

Capability I was born with
Watch you struggle, its annoying
See myself always being forced in
Selfish morons I don't do it for them
I see geniuses always giving but
My mind shined never giving up
I want status so that I can give it back
God given talents I was never given that
Work is energy stored as money
World we live in is sorta funny
If you made it did you make it right
Steal from people or you fixing strife
Everyone now gambles often
Ads don't mention how to handle losses
Greed instilled in a dopamine fix
Ask for money in the hope to be rich

I've given everything to this world
It only gives back with a certain herd
We stick together mostly cause we need to
As a tool, everyone else see's you
Sucks when you see through manipulation
Know that its happening and have to fake it
Agreeableness is a death by patience
We really due for some reparations 

I observe them and see their Big 5
Disagreeable people get high
Every fucking time they get their way
Tit for Tat you only win today
We polite so here's what you want
Avoiding you after is what you got
We all one but you living different
To keep you around is inefficient 
Giving back is our mission statement
If you incompatible you inundated 
With loneliness and a shallow soul
Cause yo only goal is you after gold
Collateral absent your word set
You ain't learned shit about the world yet
I can teach but you don't deserve it
Still I do it, and its called a purpose 

I've given everything to this world
It only gives back with a certain herd
We stick together mostly cause we need to
As a tool, everyone else see's you
Sucks when you see through manipulation
Know that its happening and have to fake it
Agreeableness is a death by patience
We really due for some reparations

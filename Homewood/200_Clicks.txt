200 Clicks

everything nowadays breeds uncertainty
I don't need ethanol making shit worse for me
never ending quest tryna find what works for me
I don't even know right now whats hurting me
stimmin with the stilt chill beat thats vibes yea
thinking about me and how I need to side step
time is factor, i'm an adapter,
but if I don't act then I can see demise yeah
I can see demise yea
I can see demise come straight from reprisal
spit from a system we built with our eyes closed
get what you get we were built for survival
real question is if I'm fit for survival
drugs I could get every click on my ride home
two hundred clicks my commute can't be mindful
distractions exist yea but so does the spiral
who do you idol, whats their mindset,
if can you meet them what time they alive at
we need to talk more but always be silent 
we need the listen but never be quiet
we paying people to listen who ramble
we paying parasites all just to gamble
I find it crazy that ChatGPT became
everyones bestie our network is scrambled
guessin this shit politicians will handle
but tech is evolving this bitch is a hassle
snake to a bear to a dragon to rassle
break in my mind got the key to the castle
AI is blind to the dangers its breeding
stats on employment are fake whatchu reading
everything changes when ain't no one eating
it all ends the same thats with everyone bleeding, yuh

we don't want that
I can only change myself
this world is crazy though
I gotta move

nanotech classmates 3 years ahead of me
they saw a future while I bought Henessy
half moved to europe and find it heavely
path that I want, a place where i'm meant to be
first comes first its the person i'm meant to be
half mapped out and the works good energy
only thing to stop me is everywhere essentially
momentum slog one drink can be the end of me
mind slides over, I can be my enemy
tactical, practical, lacks self empathy
risks don't matter maxmize entropy
I can put you back onto the wagon if you mess with me
all done chemically lets apply physics so
boundary conditions have well defined limits
and stores are outside em, some I can visit
the liquor ones nixed I stick with the vision
live with precsion and move on a mission
I practice my talents and live with conviction
life is a balanace I stuggle with wishing
that I got more time to persue what I'm missing
but I lost a lot to the call of the drink and
I'm feeling a lot of regret for decisions 
I hope to atone for the output I killed and 
then flow to a state where I know that I'm living

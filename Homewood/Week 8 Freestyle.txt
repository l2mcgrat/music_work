Week 8 Freestyle

Came in a deadbeat, fucking week 8 now,
not much has changed but, I don't feel the same now,
muscles growing, hussle showing, code uploaded brains mind,
meds down and weight down, i'm channeling a raged child,
mad at the world, I need strength to fucking take down,
everyone who stole from me, pain I'll fucking spray round,
know that I'm awake I'll, tape up my mistakes file,
everything you spoke to me so openly you hate while,
insufficient in your own ways, lets do some role play,
switch that shit around you'd kill youself was that your goal eh,
weakness and excusses of abusers shit is gourmet,
feed this meal right back to you and laugh at you no forplay,
fuck with you the guilt you feel will hurt just know its real
killing you so softly poetry is how it feels
message to the dept collectors, know an early death'll get ya
Brain was just one man, wasn't an exception betcha
more blood will poor soon, CEOs with war wounds,
theres better methods to get your wealth the stealthy had to more too
casings with adjacent statements manifestos old news
3D Print a blicky blicky finna killa old dude,
simple as accounting sounds, 100 Mil 100 Rounds,
most will soon be unemployed, sense a civic war now,
history repeats to beats, powers can always conceed,
militaries don't receed they give you up and will proceed,
revolution in nepal used discord it just sowed its seed,
evolution end of all this grifting rich go woe is me
kill em put em in a zoo, or better yet a warehouse,
or keep em couped up in a room, we don't fucking care now

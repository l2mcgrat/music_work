CuckSauce

your whole existance is that you’z a fuckin bitch
If you was a bitch I'd imagine you'd suck dick
proud of it powerful get all yo wishes
money is existence power and all efficient 
simp as in simpleton im more like ableton
I'm just more able and I'm not yo AI son
Ideally u see paradise n pray that I'll visit
I was there for health care, n I was insistent 
Emotional validation in reality don't exist
People actually complaining, if you won't resist
Just do what I say, and not what I do
Be the example for me, your a rumor dude
but simps fiend for the pussy like Drake 
you might fake real feelings just like Drake
just to taste seventeen year old pussy again
trust me old shit is better n it's working my friend
If you write for everyone, u just a popstar
I'm more like Polo G, I'm a rapstar
not gangstar, I'm white n I don't pray for it
im not weird, just another fucking genius
if you a bitch and suck dick then do it my penis
I'm not J Cole I apologize for that one
I don't need views or comments on my platforms
I just need peace or be Kendrick that's God
I'm underemphasising but he's that one 
No one to it better, I just wanna respect him
We as a society need his values projected
Everyone around me is being deceptive
I'm not one to care if I'm being rejected
Conditions are simple, just be smart and nice 
But smart is subjective, I only found it twice
That's Owen n Camille n only they get me
Seems nowadays, only they respect me
What do you envy ya that's me and my life 
There's not much to envy just me and my wife
Thats Made in Abyss and Hunter x Hunter 
Stare into them with me and see what I wonder
I see death all around me, how it concludes 
Don't see it, happy, u’se a dumb fool
Comfortable humble and knows what's coming 
K maybe not comfortable, maybe im nothin

get away with it

yeyeyeye 

I don't even know what I heard first
U heard kill yourself, then I heard worst
I survived even though this world cursed
I survived even though this world cursed
Lil Uzi Vert got this beat merked 
7inch dick and his pussy worth it
Watchin how he give his pussy purpose
Give a purse a penny callin it a Burkin 
Lil Baby taught me how to reach swag 
U can have yo confidence, keep that
It's a snow squal and I feel bad
let the chol talk, I don't mean that
yo my car just got snow plowed
let the tax talk make u fall down
I can't even fucking buy salt now
I'ma move to Europe then I'll walk now
have u ever been talked down to
If u have, I'll be around you
this disrespect isn't sound proof
stand up, you are allowed to
I thrived in Owens Maple Street
Even made dumb bitches hate me
If u want me dead bitch wait please
I just wanna sleep but u hate me
I don't want murder I aint hasty
I just want work I ain't lazy
I just want bread do you hate cheese
Of course you do you fkn hate me
I'm after paper like a Maple Tree
I'm after haters who hate me
I'll laugh when later I make peace
With all of y'all who wanna Drake me

get away with it, get away with it
if u wanna do it, get away with it
if he fuck with me, then pray for him
if he fuck with me, then pray for him
get away with it, get away with it
if u wanna do it, get away with it
if he fuck with me, then pray for him
if he fuck with me, then pray for him

Intro to Homewood

Zombie dropped me at my new home for two months
Taught by my mom friends, society, i'm too fucked
Kill yourself, you even feel yourself?
crying what about me, now i'm lifting you up,
hot bought giving me up, and putting faith in the process
all on me with new friends making progress
falls on me, when their looking ofr help
no man in the mirror, I ain't feeling myself

this that new vibe flow feeling Picasso
sleep is down and up my pills is pilling up
they say i'm wilding but I Have fine control,
everything I say is like mind control,

take that CBT and put it in reverse 
make you think bad thoughts so you working worse
so when you leave this place you gon need a nurse
get yo stomache pumped while I plead the 1st

yo my shadows shady you can call me crazy
I don't fuck with friends down and out and lazy
deep down i'm kind but don't test me maybe
you can give me space or ima make you spacey
from a place where hate being brought from nurses
and instructors, doctors, fuck it whats the purpose,
leave you feeling worthless bitch i'm here to grow,
all these toxins block me whats you reap you sow

so, so, so, so, what am I to do, uh, fuck around and lose, uh,
pick yo battles, I unleash the shadow, 
small bites no bark you gon bleed a galllon
no trace no trace DNA absent,
i'm a shot of absinthe, you go fall and splatter,
mentally explode, all your thoughts are scattered,
only thing that can stop me is a talk with Alex
if I get permission turn your thoughts to ashes

yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh,

48 thoughts talking laws of power,
I can read you like a book, I can draw the patterns,
getchya elevated, its a flaw of cowards,
then I escalate it make it fall from saturn,
job loss yo fault plus all thats after,
you won't find a saviour just enjoy the rapture,
tried to frame my ass with no picture captured,
tried to frame my ass I respond with laughter, 
tried to frame my ass they gon fix ya actions,
I'ma tame you ass, I'ma halt you passion
I'ma claim my power back from wasted talent

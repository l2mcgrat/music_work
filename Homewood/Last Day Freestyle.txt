Last Day Freestyle

last day, almost out, I can see tomorrow now,
I became a man again from a manic ass problem child,
asshole stuck in a deep ass hole if I reached up for help they'd grab my soul,
antidepressants and manic depression don't mix well with panic suppression,
I was for testing doc don't know or care how I feel, after ingesting,
that's my problem, fuck your message, I don't 'like this shit your suggesting,
here at Homewood, met real doctors, family one was always wrong,
ADHD and Bipolar I don't have em, sing your song,
bet o'll  murphy oh so worried guilt will kill that shit is real,
ain't yo first time listen more and keep ur tail tucked live in fear,
there's a history of malpractice, only use was fill out forms,
you ain't helping any addicts or anyone just know ya role,
fuck your soul and mental health,
I have goals of getting well, I'm meeting targets,
came from seltzers, ativan, no exercise, and eating garbage,
patience showing no improvements, I forsee me leaving carnage,
everyone thats insufficient, mean and selfish, being tarnished,
I'm a savage a bagde of honor, I am living breathing karma,
I don't believe in equal treatment, want my virtues seaping farther,
whatchu reaching out for father, I ain't one you need to bother,
I got to much people round me who give a shit no need to holler,
what awaits me, a new journey, sixty days plus being sober,
there just ain't no end to treatment, weakness always creaping over,
urge to alter conciousness consuming drugs is life to most
the worst a little dose can do is lead to more and spiral folks,
stressful bullshit passes out the pipe of life so find your peace
just don't think the bottom of a bottle will put your mind at ease
i'm squeeze up every bit ogt genius gained through mediation and 
privacy to be this aim up climb and see new elevation type A personality
and fuck you if your mad at me, need to live compatibly
I don't fuck with apathy and condecention maddens me
I'm expecting ego death and vibes or you don't pass the test
Fuck all your accomplishments the wisest men don't yap and flex 
Out for necks but quietly, there just ain't no firing me,
Whatchu want some soppey I can't do it bitch there's fire in me,
Irony I work this hard for me you just acquired me for now but
I got wings and i'm a fly to whats inspiring me

vibes or nothing and fuck an appearance
I been focused too long and too much on appearance these costs cause impedance 
too many people too often eat off of what im feeding energy and there's the wrong ones who want me depleated prey and want me defeated, some saw me feel needed you scoffed and discarded my feelings my only thoughts I had brought me to tears but thats how i'm grieving, no sudden missed calls i'm involved just emotionally distant and somwhat filled with lots of fears but just know its real, I know how you feel I know how you feel, that you need control, all via fears, all via fears, thats all I need to know, I got ideas to get outta here and don't lose control, you're proud of me I re-integrate and I still chose my soul, no simple path, but by chance, its what I used to know, 
just at a glance this is ants to what I used to know, its in my hands, its my future, I can view it glow, just don't burnout like a bitch and you'll be beautiful,
vibes or nothing and fuck an appearance,
if you'd give nothing you're bucked from the scene minute one fuck what you mean you know who you know who so you fucking with me bitch you fucking with me i've grown from the best and the best grow from me your under me, I don't mix up with kids who got luxury cause they have luxury the asset is company if you ask what they think you'll know chains don't come luckily, it fucks with me people still mixing up those flexing clothes bought from hussling with those bought from daddy don't rustle me,

Outside Pt.1 

Catch one outside with a hard forty on me 
I drink while I drive bitches wild if they saw me
Roll break get high 'fore I start this recording
Need to slow down time so my mind I can sort it 
Watch me bread down lines to polise I'm an issue 
Pigs catch me they can try or this crime urofficial 
If you sing while inside no bond I ain't with u 
Only tree you gon see, dry your eyes with a tissue 
Bitches vibe with the real lil homey yous a face one 
Anxiety will kill over time why I take some 
Reality's a bitch I'ma ride as I tame her 
stay tied to the ground so i'm wise to the haters
hoes crazy think they clever having simps send me death threats 
cravings over pussy they ain't never gonna get that
reality's a bitch shes a hoe I don't fuck with
them cops or them opps try to pop me for nothing,

Catch me outside with the baddest of babi's, 
The red hed the tall one the hard one dababy,
I harbour my thoughts while I'ne balling and faded, 
I'll ride of a cliff yo this lifes what you make it 

Made it to the top of the hill she give top now,
Mystique of elites I escaped from the dog pound,
Physique is os peak and her pussy is sauced out 
She drip on my drip lick the tip im her boss now
talk bout all my plans song and dance who to stomp out
we demanding for bands whatchu planning to talk bout
ain't preped in advance then you just have the wrong house,
we rasta as fuck need to chill 'fore we pop out,
its evident we messing with some fools they ain't garded,
we meddlin with minds and my tool makes them retarded,
they be mumbling and fumbling the bag they a target,
warning shots to the roof, put yo ass down for barking

Catch me outside with the baddest of babi's, 
The red hed the tall one the hard one dababy,
I harbour my thoughts while I'ne balling and faded, 
I'll ride of a cliff yo this lifes what you make it

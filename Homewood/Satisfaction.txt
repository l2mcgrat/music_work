Satisfaction

everything for passion like its wrapped up in a package
what you really doing if there isn't really actions
patterns that I failed to keep up caused disatisfaction
I just pause when I see wrath and wonder what we really after
ain't no drama that i'm wrapped in, wonder whats he really rappin
like I don't see patterns and have comments whatchu asking
is it just my fucking voice all your pain is my fault
i just won't fucking exist so you can claim your minds calm
being honest don't know what to do i'm the bain of yo problems
if i could just read yo mind then id claim that i'd solve em
but what am I to do when your crazy and i'm not
fuck i'll just kill myself is my aim that far off
why am i wasting my time if your deranged and i'm not
i'm just tryna live in peace and you claim that i'm not
whats the aim that I got its obviously tryna be sober
but in your uneducated opinion you just pray my times over
tell me that i'm wrong, explain it three times over 
if still don't get it, I think im dumb or fight info
I'f I still don't fucking get it, maybe it ain't that simple
maybe a wrinkle in the fabric of yo ideas ain't minimal
if a judge heard you talk they would label you a criminal
if a normal person heard you they'd stay away, definitive
I just want to live in peace but to you that ain't orignal
You love yo drama series to you thats vitamins and minerals
some of this isn't literal, but you need to hear it
if someone you care for cries sorry you need to see it
if someone you care for dies you need to make an appearance
but thats just too much to ask if it don't gain some alleagance
social alliances act like kitchen appliances
useful when needed then you just wanna quiet them
misunderstanding bonds cause they some aliiances
to get what you want, but what you want uninspiring
really its just some info, that you need in the moment
once they save and then say it, then in essence you own it
but being a half decent person was just never a component 
thats necessary to feeling that you don't need show it
i've been abhorent myself then collected wealth and felt free
if you ever went from oppressed to this then you get me
I don't believe in collecting wins thats envy
Seven Deadly Sins my 1st and and 2nd work, it gets deep

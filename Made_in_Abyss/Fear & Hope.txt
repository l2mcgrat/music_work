Fear & Hope 

Dancing round some problems
Probably couldn’t solve em I been tied up in my pride feeling high until i’ve fallen now im stressed and im in dept lost my calling to be solvent while im stuck  giving dividens to benefit from knowledge, I was,
not concious
still I got offers
cocky not complex,
genius, not honest,
promised family greatness but his fate remains blake
speaking mentally predict his state just stays weak, huh
despair in his mind,
so these demons creep inside,
depressions as a lesson what anxiety provides, 
while he feels lows he needs hope and no lies,  no surprise he needs dope just to copes with oh my’s, stress, feel his stress, you should know he means best, 
tired tied financially he’s weak he needs rest 
and peace with these pests the beast can eat less while we feed him greed impede him from seeing he’s regressed, huh

spirit been away
black clouds fill black balloons 
I can clear with with a wave
If my spirit was back soon
No appearences today
Five hours past noon
Im fearing this too fake
Tears falling just act cool, yuh

work, work, and work, huh
I go berserk, huh
desperate and stressed so I get overworked, huh
think im a mess, huh
hospital bed, huh
stressed to depressed im in debt over work, huh
cycles flow in spite of all the damages claimed from some economic failures need parameters changed
most of those with votes don’t give a damn if he’s paid  
so we broken out of hope and watch the planet decay, yuh fuck are we to do with all these demons creeping loose yo im tryna keep it tight but all my feelings seeping through so they claim I been unstable while im mearly seeking truths, only claim I seem to state tho was through fear we being used, huh

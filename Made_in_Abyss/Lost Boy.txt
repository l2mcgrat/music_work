Lost Boy 

Times of changed, how times of changed
Minds have aimed towards pride n pay
I have aged now im sad to say
I see tidal waves that AI’ll make

Social fabric with an massive tear
Hope is magic with sum passion there
I just stare can’t feel their pain
tho I just care that I see their sain

threat lurks for my neck sure but this
stress hurting my net worth and I 
need peace to contain some strain when I deep breath I receive some aid for my 

Shoulder pain cause I fucked up now im
Broke enraged with a gun tucked
Focus aim to being rich and lax 
i think hope is raised when hes gives it back

but he gets trust with that one point one 
or he’s giving up on that o point one 
thats free money this shits easy 
only spend shit when you get sleasy 

magna carta you don’t have to barter
job god you don’t have to start up 
treat him well and he’ll fuck your bitch
just some concrete jungle fuckboy shit

luck is working still scared of life
got a perfect 12 with my pair of dice
I was lost and hurting this land of snakes
but the cost was worth it if the damage fades

im happy now, but the demons lurking 
it’ll all be over if they breach the surface
i live calm or i die traggic
cause a rich folk live so savage

my minds messed,the circuits perking
my high sesh, is the purchase worth it
your highness, born rich bitch
in a high chair, you don’t risk shit,

you a lost boy shit so am I
in a broken world we go broke and die
which laws bruh did u go and change 
in this broken world we go broke and aim, yuh

[beat swtich]

nananananana

living with fear spining inside 
infinite pain feel it or die
going insane villian in spite
of everything he did this life
socially accepted 
or we won’t recieve his blessing
we rejected from the libra 
he the devil read the message 

I’s off mad then i said somn
hog tied when I read somn
can’t pay cause of harsh words 
man tame but he starved first 
gate keepers elitest 
I don’t think that you should reason
I was decent as a starter 
ima martyr you should read this

for its too late but its too late 
cause I ain’t shit in a new day
no rejects in the internet
yet tech nerds gon benefit
for data from yo bae, yuh
no game bruh he a player
got mad nudes you a sad fool
gotta arm up use that tool 

im mad too, 
but keep I calm n I act cool
cause the deep fall is a sad truth 
yo I see loss but i reap costs as an app tool and
this shit got me crazy yo this shit got me crazy
rips the minds eye 
yo this shit got me lazy

calculated as fuck 
but still I swim like a baby, huh
aggrivated as fuck 
but still im wiped like its slavery, yuh
top 4 percent of wages 
for my age so just maybe 
I have studied economics 
god this logic its savory, yuh

bright lights is the past honest 
zeitgeist is the mass concious
fuck with me if the path balling 
but you stuck with me don’t act cautious
rise up to elitists 
r.i.p to who decieve us 
I was meekest as a child 
now I wild till you defeated

but im pissed of and exhausted 
n I just saw whats its costing 
im a lost boy in a cruel world
in three year meet a coffin
i feel fear ain’t seemin honest 
i still care if you been concious
no real here just false profits n
billionaires with off logic 

and asuming industries 
like the music industry
gave a fuck about the death
and legacy of x n peep
they’d make music in the streets
praise the town they represented
not abuse him with the streams
like a coward I resent and

i’m a lost boy with a hate vice 
if I talk shit I get paid twice 
obnoxioius and I hate life
im on shit for a safe life
unconcious in the brain like
when you on shit but the state right 
so im got in to the vape hype
now im coughin cuz i hate life,

being unconcious what the brain seeks
bae im on shit do you hate me
cause you pompus with a waist like 
if im honest could get a pay hike
cause the hotness is insane, yuh
if you talk shit i can’t blame yuh
could be top tier with a sport star
riding top gear in a sports car

yeah yuh posh bitch you a risk at best
but ima give you more gifts until you’ll git the rest
divorce fight wars over hoards from quests
that I endored my reward was when i’d dole whats left 

so i’ve contained my pain to you I doled whats left
but then again I might say to you I hold much less
pride inside the looka wrath I see a set of empty grins
future virtue good or bad I see some seven deadly sins, 

so if you here when I blow, show intent to interject 
cause when im fearful i’ll know, you’ll invest to get the net and fuck them earfuls I hold n I repress to fight pests
I fuck with peace or don’t cuz all this stress denies rest, yh

“gotta be able to sleep at night mans,
shit makes you live longer”

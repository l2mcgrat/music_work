Into the Abyss 

Die or explore, stay alive n adore,
nights like this with a life like yours
quiet quite poor I don’t mind my floor
but if my hype soar don’t mind my roar,
natures a bitch she mine not yours 
genes are a fit ya she fine, hot, warm
natures a bitch yeah natures a threat 
but if natures was sick then natured infect
death every turn so the stress carry burns
erry lil pest is a threat to eject
get very scurred so the stress carry burns
erry lil stress 50 breath till he dead
ware and tare kills try to carry them ills
government check fina levy them bills
every damn pill go parry them feels 
till you numb in the face I don’t envy them thrills, yuh
and no one cares
most peoples dying and no ones there
sacler injects opiods for the net so im
sad some soul gon be void for a check
pain comes back then the rain comes back
train him with pain where his bank rolls at
game is insane cause their ain’t no back
for the snakes with the reins where the bank notes at 
and no one cares
made in abyss yo no ones there
go on scared you don’t know whats creeping
and you go on spared untill you show upp weakened
predators ahead of him he see’s it first 
born in world where demons lurk
seeking real I might die vie snakes 
see this hope feel recognize my faith, huh

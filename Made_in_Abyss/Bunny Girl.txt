 I’d even love you if you wasn’t there

Hope and fear you go with me but I don’t know whats next, yo you sober my put hope in me but I been so perplexed yo you hate me and you love me and I need the way you judge me but you fucked me when you talked up me as daddy after sex, yuh,  
angry, sad, messed, as bad as it gets
bipolar, catched via stress by a net 
I don’t scar from my lows i just meant ya my best 
high hopes to tightropes so im scared to die less, yuh
strained by the distance know the pain spikes inhibit 
I complain like an infant no aims im indifferent 
i’ve was on my way to great till i was chained by some bitches, mind tamed till insane i’ve contained prior visions, wanna make it to the stage where I make it to a wage that enables me the time to train a brain thats in a cage, I don’t want it to decay, fear is killing it with age, aimed for moving past it missed and strayed into a rage,
shadow resurfaced cause i failed to integrate it
think im calculated as fuck but actually kinda faded had to purchase all this dope need ta cope with hard pain
surges in the dose he approachin not sain, yuh
fuck with me today, when or will you run away, its been killing me in secret, I been filling up with pain,
yo I love you and i miss you while I aim for better days,
I just hope you know i’Il think of you to stay forever sain, love me

 I’d even love you if you wasn’t there
 I’d even love you if you wasn’t there
 I’d even love you if you wasn’t there
 I’d even love you if you wasn’t there, yuh

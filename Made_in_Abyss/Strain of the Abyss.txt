Strain of the Abyss

yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh
scared straight
girl smart but she dead weight
my heart cold and my head ache
im hardcore so I stress, strain to the best state
im ahead maybe with a blessed bae
im a mess crazy with the stress, eh
im so attached got a lot to lose
so im smoke it back tho my lung is brused
my hope is that I can make some meaning 
but my focus wack i mistake some feeling 
for real truth I feel new 
but at times im just being used 
fo dopamine cash 
dope and weed ass 
hope n greed mix
dopamine fix 
hope is we lax 
time flies by 
hope is we pass 
side by side 
fuck wit me bae 
something weak but 
stuck wit me eh 
unelite one
fuck what you think 
im a be somn
im a rise up
im a beast huh

self doubt,
pride pries inside the mind,
creation of weakness instead of meekness
strain of the abyss see our blood is leaking
timed flies by
weak verses should I be rehearsing 
most ditch just to be elite
strain of the abyss how it weakens me

scared straight cause the consqeunces of a cruel world is a dead state, im in love now if I lost is all id pop pills till the stress fade this blessed bae is my only love and the only one who injects pain soul source of meaning plus heavens gates in a short call she could devastate 
im yours now but don’t hesitate
to write me off find a better mate 
leave a broken boy with a lot of thoughts 
either meditate or il medicate
grab OE mixed with juice swirl
till I OD for the news girl
yo eyes on me short flame I 
either die in vain or my name die

self doubt,
pride pries inside the mind,
creation of weakness instead of meekness
strain of the abyss see our blood is leaking

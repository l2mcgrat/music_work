You Should Know

Pissed as shit feel like Sisyphus
An easier life i’ve been jipped of this 
All yall lazy im sick of it 
I’m bitching but you get the jist of it 
In this complex world we depend on all
But yall ain’t shit cause my friends all are 
So where does this leave me best believe me 
I’m blessed I ain’t yall cause you just displease me

Chaos control I am in the zone 
Money over bitches im Al Capone
M.O.B but its deeper than rap 
Power means freedom ima keep with the facts

Now if two times two is four you should know
There is food by the shoot in my room you should know
I done wasted this shit im a fool you should know 
And im wasted cause life is bitch you should know 
I can’t face it yo im just a bitch you should know
But im nine out of ten of you fools you should know
And im high two times out of two you should know
But im wise I could tutor a tool you should know

Real truth is we all slaves to the system
Shareholders own CEO’s through stcoks 
Cops in america kill with they pistols
Working for the government and they bought
By the same CEO’s who demand a quota
Yall done pissed me off I demand its over
All this new age shit started rare like hova
On the shoulders of giants they can carry boulders 

haaaah haaaah, thats a lot of weight yall, must be hard carrying the whole culture like that

Now the worlds inefficient fixed for the richest 
Im on a hit list if I could fix it 
Im all out of ideas here’s a question
If we went and spread the wealth well whats the digits
Now theres 7.5 billion people alive
What we’ll do is assume we wanna keep em alive 
M3 works out to about 75 trill 
10 G quick mafs we ain’t gettin by well
Divided out we don’t live the same 
And them old heads saying all these kids to blame
But they the ones in power who exist in shame 
Cause they haven’t done shit but bitch complain
Got my eyes on my phone cause im reading quantum
LED’s are cool cause what I see is awesome 
We were raised on the internet see us blossem
This the information age ima automate the world 
Im a Nano Engineer ima pollonate your girl
Then il get my mind in gear when im on my way to work
Cause I can’t catch feels when she cheating thats weird
But she can’t the pass D if she fiending thats real

I’m a flawed little boy thats true you should know
I’m a raw real boy thats true you should know
But im a tad disappointed at you you should know
Cause yall after this cash like its truth you should know
Thats lifes more than pussy and cars you should know
That there’s warmth if you look in you heart you should know 
The poor have been torn apart you should know
Theres reward in you soul if you dole you should know
But if you so dead set on control you should go
Smoke weed just relax with a toke you should go
To sleep cause you ass ain’t woke you should know
Cause you ain’t doing shit you bitch you should know

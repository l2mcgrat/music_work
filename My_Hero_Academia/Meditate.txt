Meditate

Go through 12g’s a week just to stay chill
5 midterms a week it pays just to stay still
7 finals hell i’m whiling all A’s and stakes kill
Spendin less to afford this cause chasing dreams pays well
Regimen for a 6pack self conciosus can’t fix that
Child emerging from chaos I was never taking a day off 
Grown spirit through impact I teach people I give facts
Got a fire mind my brains all like gimme weed now sit back
I feel like without weed, im weak, its what I need 
My mindstate is irate without it ya see 
Haven’t been good ever since that heaven sent mistress
Seems with no one to impress my minds in distress
What is one day of pain for a life out of my cage
Cause this green and this T hurt my breath so I age
Wanna see past this page cause my future is bright
On an ultralight beam all the hoopla’s in sight
I’m new to the hype but i’m keeping it calm
Its my motto in life, that, and seeing me ball
I reach for the stars brace myself for the fall
If I can’t keep up the pace then I can’t place with the god’s

(Talk about how there’s a way out called meditation, end the sentence with the word riiiiiiiggghhht)

Here’s a secret you should preach it yo I know way out 
called breathing you can see if you don’t need to vape now
But im feeling like I need it hows this supposed to play out
If tweaking and indecent how am I supposed to stay down  
I do it when I need it to be gaining some control
Without it im complaining why am pleading save his soul
With silence im inside this perfect place and feeling whole
But without it im defiant pilot satan taking toll

In the matrix making dope 
Talk to god im taking notes
DMT is teaching me 
How to vibe creating flow
Frequency just speaks to me
I try to have the decency
To tune into some peace to see 
We all just waving bro
Fuck all the hating bro
Thats why im inhaling smoke
Can’t be mad and faded no 
Can’t be sad when making jokes
Can’t be that impatient yo
Im fucking sad to say it tho
I fucking have to make it so
my ass is stationed, go

Going up to the man in first place and asking, “this your first day?”
If you tryna win the race then whyyy you ain’t looking thirsty
The grind up to the top has got yall whiling falling off
If I could rise up in one shot i’d probly die not far enough
I get high just starting up its cause my life is really nice when filled with hype what do I like besides a mic a wild night then five 5 dikes with smiles white get my dick defiled right these seven sins that they catch me in in my mind don’t shine bright 

The darkness yeah it sharpens as my sharpness gets retarded 
I just started with dart and now im out I beg your pardon
Charted all the land and found that i’m regarded 
As disgusting plus im farther from the plan that I imparted
 
Gotta chill calm down cause as I see the cards now
There’s a toll im taggin on with all these harmful compounds
Know that harm will compound thats the shit im on now
Everybody cheats their way to peaceful states somehow

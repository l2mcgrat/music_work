I don’t know, i don’t know, i don’t know if il find love in this world
Its so cold, its so cold, its so cold out here no love with these girls
I’ve tried once, i’ve tried twice, but this power seems to be what they want
She could be, she could be, could be falling i’d catch her im my arms
Im just a stupid romantic tryna deal with sociopaths
Hoes just make me go so manic ima needa smoke fo that
Cheating bitches ain’t my business they just care to hide they rep
If I would not come off so petty i’d tell the next guy watch yo step

Now in this line I begin to define hoe versus slut homie get yo term straight
sluts just fuck while hoes fake love but don’t give a fuck then cheat on your birthday
sluts want attention, hoes want attention, only difference is a sluts worth defending
hoes keep secrets, sluts want mentions, hoes want bros to control thats intended
hoe’s go from like ‘I care about you’, to ‘you ain’t worth shit and im better without you’
sluts be like, ‘wanna fuck tonight, don’t exchance names cause we done tonight’
and its funny right, cause I claim to chase real love for life, but sex with sluts with no emotions bests a heart broken when its all over cause the rest of us
wanna happy homie at the festival cause we turning up while the rest of yall worry bout your stories on your snapchat im on soundcloud you can’t snap back
if you subsnap with some nasty shit, ima write a song im surpassing it, I express myself you can hear my lyrics you can go on genius if you wanna read it, 
it might be about you but I ain’t go say, you do mind games but I ain’t the same, cause I know what I want its true love, and to get there you don’t manipulate.

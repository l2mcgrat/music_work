Growing Up

Is caring about others really natural, or does it make sense nowaday

How is one to take care of someone else when one can’t even take care of oneself 
All these lines that im tweaking all these rhymes that im thinking all the time I be living like something else
See this modern day life like a horror story
We don’t try to change lives we live for the glory
Talking Elon Musk and what see from Trump
Hide a wasteland of lies imported for ya
Kids with cancer cases how do they grow up
As the cancer grows every day more tough
Wonder what if all they problems done came on us 
We’d of solved it in a day but the pain on em
Fucked up ain’t in its just how I see the world
We don’t care for each other less we all feel the hurt
When the globe is warming we ain’t all being burnt
But Irma Jose and Harvey I recall being cursed 
What the fuck you gonna do when it happens to you
Unless we all grow up and stop acting a fool
Went from motto fix the problem tryna live without fear to the motto fuck tomorrow ima live without care 
Solve it if I wanna i’m Liam McGrath
Fuck it im a liar but im steaming with wrath
Pissed at the state of the state im irate
But if I can’t see it replaced am I great
Am I worthy of judgeing if ain’t I ready for judgement
Would what I could’ve done with that same power in government 
Save the people in hundreds from the streets or the suffering 
Or would the seats of his people impeach him for loven it
I’m indecent or something because I do what I want
If I be helping the helpless I could care for the cost
Fucking take risks daily i’m prepared for a loss
You couldn’t pay me to hate me I could care if im wrong
You might call it pride but im embarrassed inside 
Surrounded by so few who have caring in mind
I see children with kids but I be parentin mine
Lil Babies with bibs all fucking scared in the mind
And then I look to myself at times I need help
That goes for my mama to when ours minds in hell
Through pressure i’ve been pressed into a diamond cell
Meditate to stay calm that way my mind is well
That state is kinda swell but some box me out
They annoying as fuck I try to not speak out
This fucking ignorance shit has gotten out of control
Ain’t fucking into this shit i’m watching as in unfold
Those lacking basic awareness come and call me child 
But they the ones acting wild don’t fucking make me smile
If you learn to split emotions and your motions you’ll be golden
Instead you got testostorone projecting where your going

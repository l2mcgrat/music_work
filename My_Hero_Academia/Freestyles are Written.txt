Freestyles Are Written

On my new perspective shit
Tryna find the evidence 
All the rappers messages 
Can’t come out so effortless
But still I tweak
Until my art is sound
And if it wreeacks 
You know exactly what this shits about 
You know what I mean
Treating freeing 
Likes its a gene
Is a freaky thing
If it ain’t really what it seems
I ain’t into screens
Only showing certains scenes 
What it really mean
Yall tryna keep ya shit clean
Not too pristine 
Few flaws and fluke bar
cause you raw bitch please
I had it wrong you just weak
Expectations at the top
Two weeks pass an album drops 
Seems you free like that a lot 
Until I see your album flopped
Don’t hate neither 
I could get Jay to breath ether 
Prides sour might cower
miss being a B keeper 
Honeys money oh its funny
how its something till you comfy
With a Bae and hey she lovely
Can’t playing and being cuddly
Trust me I been with real bitches
Straight up no feels bitches
Change now I feel different 
I don’t fucking need bitches
I need scriptures from Yeesus 
Who breads pictures I need this 
The fames key to the change we need difference 
just saying we keep itching and laying we keep snitching its lame the cop shit is insane we pop fix in the vain 
unconcious in the brain a contest for the fame a conquest that is vain im honest im jus saying


Yuh and I ain’t fucking with normies
its because they annoy me
and they shit it amorphous 
and my shit is enormous 
don’t you say that im corny
what im saying is important 
you can take it in portions
ima blame the endorphins 
claiming that i’m goergeous fuck em they don’t really see me 
amazing pretty people only see em on the TV
staging acts when at a concert shit it really bonkers 
Staging laughs is always funny nigahiga teehee
X and Pac were legends how the left us cause they kept up with their purpose up ever working then were murdered was worth it probably serving someones ego while the killers serving time while the world has lost the realest and the fakest still alive 
Fake free’s from fake G’s is waste shit I ain’t pleased
Yall ain’t Em or Jay-Z don’t pretend you ain’t weak
You learned rap in 8 weeks then fell off the same week
Its bullcrap that fake beats out real that just ain’t me
People follow idols what they say and do it vital
But celebrities are selfish so I guess we’ll keep it tribal
There’s eventually a medalist when fighting for survival 
We are meant to be at peace but that don’t keep the tyrants high tho
S  even deadly sins we all binge no one wins  
You won’t get me if you deadbeats don’t respect me no offense
But my style is so intense you noticing my whole intent 
Im just tryna save some tree’s and hoping more will go invest

You Saved Me 

Verse 1

Yuh
This the last song bros 

Woah Woah Woah Woah
Woah Woah Woah Woah
Woah Woah Woah Woah
Woah Woah Woah Lets go 

Never thought that better art would come from these new kids 
OG’s so cozy from hoodlems to new cribs 
Shit talk amusing for shit flopped you stupid
These kids on computers but you just abused it (porn sound)

I can’t help but feel that I been let down
Listen to the classics I don’t feel it now
Of course there’s some exceptions but I came 
to hear a story all this hate on mumble rapping if you listen it ain’t boring 

XXXTentacion the closest thing to 2Pac
Go and check the impact whats the closest thing you got
Their lectures made me cry wonder why these legends die
Their tale il surely tell so their message stays alive 

Course now we gotta sort through all this fake deep shit
Predictable lines you know this makes me sick (laugh)
Copied suicide tracks you decide who’s wack 
Those who lying for flack or those who rhyme to impact 

Verse 2

Now try to take time and vie to redesign your mind see what you’ll find you’ll realise is we ain’t ever been fine
From fearing poverty to getting cheated all the greed and those condeeded with no chill are so elitest honestly

The sickness tends to thicked with additional sin 
Until we prisoned ciitizens an unconditional end
Unskilled are getting killed like fucking pigs in pen
Presciptions make us ill our minds are wicked again

Thats where music comes in its amusing at worst 
Its confusing somethings but still I use it at work
My environment saved me my requirement maybe
Outside of its wack i’ve defined it as crazy

All you normies destroy me cause I was born to be different
We all wanna change the world but i’m just more on the mission
Gotta plan and a vision and i’m just playing with a piston
just tryna reach top speed to top the please god speed 

I still get chills when I hear 2pac speak
Since X got killed I follow new laws see
I been ditching all my sinning and im thinking awful different positive your propositions even prompt the opposition

Verse 3

Never thought of suicide but hardly unified with life  
Clever parts some conciousness saw you and I as just hype
Forever harmed the world was dark fewer blessing was in sight
Never caught appreciating or addressing all the light

Now I see all the options its daunting but watch me  
Put thoughts into plotting then jot it can’t stop me
Reach fame hit up Joey complain bout a business 
The top shit i’l bottom their stock till efficient

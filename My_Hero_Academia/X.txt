What is Sadness 

Came up on ya shit through XXL
Never would’ve that X’d sell
Different man in a band of misfits 
Little did I know this man was gifted
Every little thing was so important 
From Kill Me, to Jocelyn Flores
Going through things when I first heard it
I felt something then I kept working 
Little did I see it eased the brain
Soft spoken blessing that eased the pain
I started to need it now he’s to blame 
U was left there bleeding c’est la via insane
XXX you was decent man
You were in a good spot you were keeping tame 
Positive talk you’dve always been hot
Cause you’ve always been real in a land where we not 
I guess what hurts most is that i’m needin you here 
Wish I could talk to god about keeping you here 
On the face of this earth you were making it better 
Your strength in your words il remeber forever
I was waiting for what you Joey’s making together
Talkin pro shit who will make it this era
Now im thinking what is sadness and you makin it clearer 
Now im dealin with demons that see in the mirror

I tried meditating and I cried so why am I still devistated my eyes won’t dry I don’t feel elevated since you died so why is my mind decidated still trying to decide why am I so wild how am I to replace it yo i’ve tried so hard but my wires is a blazing your rhymes was amazing my eyes went wide when the Broward County Sherrif came out with the statement 

So I smoked 4g’s that day just to stay sain 
Low output druggie just as they say 
But you make me wanna change cause I saw your ways
Started out boxed in then dissolved your cage 

I dreamnt one day we could conversate 
How the worlds fucked up just contemplate 
What if all the hate went and turned to love 
Then it spark real talk n problems turned to dust

You were making it happen I was watching it happen
You were making it rapping I was watching and clappin
Now im chillin in corner with a bib marijuanna 
im a cig smoking stoner yo I been unimportant 
And I been unimpressed by my childish way 
I don’t even have it hard fuck and im in pain
The devil hails in hell and its diamond rain
Am I genius bipolar or am I insane 

I guess what i’m saying is you messed me up
And then put me together you impressed me bruh
Oh the wicked alure you depressed me bruh
Your the sickness and cure feel youd get me bruh 
And your one of three rappers who have made me cry
Its weird how those feelings keep me tame inside 
As an artists the catharsis you imparted was regarded 
As some Tupac level heart man why the fuck have you departed 
Yo you changed the way I think cause before i was retarded 
Now im witty silly get me I don’t care if I be chartin
Only reason to be famous is to rap with those who made it 
Joey Cole is where im aiming don’t mistake it im impatient
Time has been decreasing yo it seems you all decaying 
and we needing people preaching not religious but im praying that your legacy withstands all the sands of time 
R.I.P Jahseh Onfroy why you have to die 

(He was taking us to a more positive world)

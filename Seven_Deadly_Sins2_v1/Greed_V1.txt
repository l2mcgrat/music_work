Greed_V1

I want everything I want everything
I was born different with a better brain
I want everything I want everything
I'm been told I'm special and in every way
A genius is how they define me
Broken inside, it divides me
I have no faith in their findings
I'm so scared of what they might think
I been trying to kill my ego
Don't just hype me I'm no hero
I am selfish, fucking worthless
Still I sense a fucking purpose
Dead inside is one thing that i'm not
Alcohol my liver might rot
Greed is slowly filling my thoughts 
I want ten times all that I got
I've been told I'm special different
I just try to get more efficient
I'm improving more like every second
Time spent perfecting methods
I think I'm owed everything now
I'm been told how things'll play out
I'm not one to disagree with
I want everything I believe in
I just speak and leave you speechless
In the presence of a teacher
I just want to live in peace but
I'm collecting thought believers
Obligation I ought to be with them
Honesty no plot or secrets and 
I can see thru all the heathens and
All the demons that they got creeping in
I want everything I want everything
I was born different with a better brain
I want everything I want everything
I'm been told I'm special and in every way
I been moving just how i'm told you
Fuck everything that the devil sold you
I got Pasteur's that pass me advice
All my actions active I'm alive
All my passion lives thru aura
What i'm lacking, how I move forward
What'll happen if I die now
I attract it and y'all find out
I got work and i'ma grind down
To the bone but I think that I'll thrive now
Everything is out of sight but 
Im just tryna lift my mind up
People crush it people raise it
Some see genius peak appraisal 
I just do whats in my nature
I won't lose or be a hater
I just move to where I make stuff
I'm unusually I do prayer
I've been taught that i think different
Still i'm moving inefficient
I want everything I want everything
I was born different with a better brain
I want everything I want everything
I'm been told I'm special and in every way
I want everything I want everything
I was born different with a better brain
I want everything I want everything
I'm been told I'm special and in every way

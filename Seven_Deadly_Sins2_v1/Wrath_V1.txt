Wrath_V1

What you do and say is up to me
My arrogance lives subtly
I don't think you should fuck with me
I confirm I can live comfortably
You're subject to my wrath
I can publish yo lying path
I can son you for the fuck of it
I can kill you for the fun of it

Got no life of death warmth in me
No fun in living improperly
Die now fucking die now bitch
Find out how you can lie snitch
Find out how to vibe switch
Find out how who my kind is
Find out how to crash out
All yo stories make em pass out
Do everything for my angle
Radiant I got a bag now
Fully loaded with swag powers
Family strong that family matters
I don't wanna irritate Pasteur's
But the peak can say what really happened
And I can say what really happened
And she can say what really happened
You defenseless you wrong bro
She protects it cause you have power
She don't need a fucking song tho
To bread a washed up sigma child
All this shit, seem so wild now
I hope rents don't ever find out
She feel like dying every hour
Eyes of a genius heavy bags uh
I would leavy every tax bruh
There's potential just some facts uh
Masterpiece out every minute
He just hopes that she will finish
She just hope's that he will finish
Please don't read this every sentence
I see that there is no winning
I give friends up and im sinning

What you do and say is up to me

I can son you for the fuck of it
I can kill you for the fun of it

Update all about my mom
She trying, bowing to her wrongs
I'm lying, don't feel bad for it
My Pasteur's paint a path forward
I got vices gotta act on it
There's prices I gon ask for it
My devices keep me real zen
My advice is be a real man
My sacrifices I can feel them
My lack in life I can feel it
I'm tracking all of it right now
I'm tracking all of it right now
Love and hate is a bitter taste
Being honest or it's been a waste
How i'm offered a dinner plate 
Is a miracle I ain't been a saint

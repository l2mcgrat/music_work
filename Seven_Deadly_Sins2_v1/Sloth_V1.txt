I need change yea I need change now
Too long being taking the pain route
Self inflicted I think bout it
Self inflicted I I think bout it
Why the fuck do I drink now
Future dusty can't paint clouds
Too many problems to take out
Too many problems to take out

I need change yea I need change now
Too long being taking the pain route
Self inflicted shit I think bout 
Self inflicted shit I think bout 
Why the fuck do I drink now
Future dusty can't paint clouds
Too many problems to take out
Too many problems to take out

Paralyzed in a sick trance
All eyes on sycophants 
Gimme something to sing and dance to
Intellectually realize you 
Gimme something I can work with
driving motive defining purpose
provide focus, I’ll find it worth it
otherwise, I comply to curses
Just want peace and next steps
Less effort and less checks
I'm just doing my best yea
I'm just doing my best yea
Days off now I can't stop
Stress ripping my face off
Genes meaning no hair loss
But keratin still wearing off
Like me there's no production
Depressed please notice something
EtCh when i notice function
I just can't be sober hundred
Days and nights I made it thru
Now I know I can make it too
People claim they seeking changes
but I just don't see it frankly
I dun changed a hundred ways now
Just to see a fucking way thru
All this misery and pain how
do you shift and see a way out
I just want my mind at peace
and TcH provide release
Promise i'm still doing things
When paralyzed I move in place

Moving just thru space and time
Know I can't press play, rewind
To time when things were simple
I just wanna be forgive'd though
Know I've sinned at every chance
Be okay and in advance
I thank god for Ativans

I'm just seeking feeling calm
What it takes fit in my palm
Know it makes me feeling wavy
I'm my mind I'm feeling lazy
Projects ain't what I was born in
all my job is to support em
clarity when facing demons
I just hope that they defeat them
I been working on mine too
Clocking in on time too
Doing everything being expected
Here but I still feel neglected
Basics asks are small tasks
Facing life in small batches
Neurotypicals all passive
It all feels like sloth actions
I know when my sloth active
Smell is present small fragments
Please I ask don't test my breath
Knowing I ain't present yet
Know I've sinned at every chance
Be okay and in advance

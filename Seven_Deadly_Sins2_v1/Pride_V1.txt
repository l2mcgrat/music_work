Pride_V1

reflecting on my old ways
three goals yea three goals eh
getting physical was the first one
athlete of the year lets go son
next was grades they all A's
them hundies ain't really hard, eh
last was emotions and social bonds
i'll fuck my bitch and choke her hard  
its a system so then I can game it
that culture wisdom, ain't hard to fake it
that business talk just how to game it
I don't embrace it I fucking hate it
pride in status still exists
ain't gonna lie its really hits
thats a solid twelve year gap tho
I dun switched up all my values

I been lost inside my mind
and I just wanna adapt though
but i'm addicted to the high 
that I made it in the castle
no prediction I could rise
but the data isn't factual
so refresh your data, sigh,
see prediction vs. actual
I thread the needle too many times
nerve issues fetal my health in decline
drug addict till I don't need it
cause gluttony something undefeated
pride is there to keep me sain
but only when I'm feeling pain
I don't wanna feel this way
I don't want to feel this way

2 Months of Rehab Humbled Me
Still I lived in luxury
Had the greatest company
All of them had love for me
All of them had love to give
Prides aside its safe to talk
This is real, how comfort feels
Daily we were taking walks
Daily we were playing chess
Life outside ain't painless 
Daily we would learn to cope
Psychology we learn the scope
Tools to apply upon release
I was only given two weeks 
Made it out with good intentions
turns out i'm still wreckless

i'm lost inside my mind
and I just wanna adapt though
but i'm addicted to the high 
that I made it in the castle
no prediction I could rise
but the data isn't factual
so refresh your data, sigh,
see prediction vs. actual
I thread the needle too many times
nerve issues fetal my health in decline
drug addict till I don't need it
cause gluttony something undefeated
pride is there to keep me sain
but only when I'm feeling pain
I don't wanna feel this way
I don't want to feel this way

Envy_V1

Pre-Verse

Success really been haunting me 
I been shopping at dollar tree
I'll always think bout probably
They worked hard for it all properly
Now that I'm roomies with my mom
No more girls seem to wanna be involved
That's some agony I didn't solve
They getting married I've been a dog

We all came from the same program
We all paid for the same slow dance
Graduated with a little know how
Funny how we all didn't know how 
To make it thru but we faked it different
Other roles, we would take positions 
Came down to how we self taught
Our future ain't really came bought
Its a never ending stream of jumps
and em drugs I always needed some
held me back and I'll admit it 
but it fucks me up how my life different
what could've been and what it isn't 
what could've been and what it isn't
the sin of envy its a growing signal
my luck is off and i'm going mental

Success really been haunting me 
I been shopping at dollar tree
I'll always think bout probably
They worked hard for it all properly
Now that I'm roomies with my mom
No more girls seem to wanna be involved
That's some agony I didn't solve
They getting married I've been a dog

Feeling of failure is being pronounced
My family claiming that I've been a clown
Alcoholic there's a path to solve it
But anxiety makes me have to haul it
I might need it but I know i'll feed in
People nervous when they see me weaken
But I have a purpose hope that people see it
But they don't listen no point in speaking

Lately finding I been lacking bias
Sycophants I know I'll find em

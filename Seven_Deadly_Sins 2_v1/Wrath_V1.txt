Wrath_V1

What you do and say is up to me
My arrogance lives subtly
I don't think you should fuck with me
I confirm I can live comfortably
You subject to my wrath
I can publish yo lying path
I can son you for the fuck of it
I can kill you for the fun of it
Got no life of death warmth in me
No fun in living improperly
Die now fucking die now bitch
Find out how you can lie snitch

Find out how to vibe switch
Find how who my kind is
Find out how to  crash out
All yo stories make em pass out
Do everything for my angle
Radiant I got a bag now
Fully loaded with swag powers
Family strong that family matters
I don't wanna irritate Pasteur's
But the truth what really happened

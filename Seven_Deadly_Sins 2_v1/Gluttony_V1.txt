Gluttony_V1

what do you do when it speaks to you
talking bout what all them demons do
how much is enough you don't need it dude
I know people who can't drive a vehicle
I know people who ain't got no work now
all them demons creep in they don't turn down
stress is oppressive you'll lose sleep
them demons are screaming just use me

fate is uncertain my mind is in shambles
guessing my test how much hell I can handle
some saw, how I managed in paradise
thought I did awesome but wasn't preparing right
outside the Garden of Eden is heathens
distressed so often was falling to pieces
feeling of weakness is what the disease is
fuck all your feelings and stop preaching Jesus
AA people, the closest equivalent
everyone else is so fucking ambivalent 
do what you preach and just keep it consistent
so little effort and peaking resistance
current events lately weaken my spirit
better prepare cause I happened to hear it
half of me working and half of me sinning
guessing the curses of gluttony are winning

all them demons creep in they don't turn down
stress is oppressive you'll lose sleep

demons are working on gods time too
pickup the signals the light shines thru
sensing some static cause I am an addict
refresh my mind when i'm calling an addict
they got more years off than peers got off days
welcome you in and you ain't gotta pay
don't think I've ever been closer to god
see all my actions and notice facade
I cheat the systems in place to prevent me 
from ever being real and just calm and accepting
Guessing my preference is most just reject me
and I stick to real ones no feelings projected
I see a lot of deficiencies present 
with regular people who speak with no effort
I just want peace but the substance that gives it
is destined weaken my spirit and essence

Lust_V1

all started out as a simple crush
looking back now wouldn't hit it once
lost V card before eighteen 
properly quality grade meat
first bitch ditched cause she gazing
thought Uni dick could be amazing
here I was taught to be faithful
but these thots are raised ungrateful
real love I didn't want to wait for
got jacked and I got brain more
next girlfriend waited 5 years
even then prior had a side piece
she was everything that my mind needs
so I found a reason to provide things
I worked hard and I'd by bling 
and work thru all of her fights think
about wet ass pussy that's all it took me
my mental health didn't matter fully
so the alcohol put me to sleep
and became a habit that stuck to me
this a sad story no happy ending
we cried together we past pretending
there's no future for our soundtrack
3 months later I bounced back
I stopped drinking got a six pack
was back in business macking on em bitches
I messaged Mel she provided wisdom
this time around the vibe different
and so now I know that she wanted me
and my past actions still haunting me
I had a baddie that followed me
everywhere I went and coddled me

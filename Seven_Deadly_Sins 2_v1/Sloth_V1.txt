I need change yea I need change now
Too long being taking the pain route
Self inflicted I think bout it
Self inflicted I I think bout it
Why the fuck do I drink now
Future dusty can't paint clouds
Too many problems to take out
Too many problems to take out

I need change yea I need change now
Too long being taking the pain route
Self inflicted shit I think bout 
Self inflicted shit I think bout 
Why the fuck do I drink now
Future dusty can't paint clouds
Too many problems to take out
Too many problems to take out

Paralyzed in a sick trance
All eyes on sycophants 
Gimme something to sing and dance to
Intellectually realize you 
Gimme something I can work with
driving motive defining purpose
provide focus, I’ll find it worth it
otherwise, I comply to curses
Just want peace and next steps
Less effort and less checks
I'm just doing my best yea
I'm just doing my best yea
Days off now I can't stop
Stress ripping my face off
Genes meaning no hair loss
But keratin still wearing off
Like me there's no production
Depressed please notice something
EtCh when i notice function
I just can't be sober hundred
Days and nights I made it thru
Now I know I can make it too
People claim they seeking changes
but I just don't see it frankly
I dun changed a hundred ways now
Just to see a fucking way thru
All this misery and pain how
do you shift and see a way out
I just want my mind at peace
and TcH provide release
Promise i'm still doing things

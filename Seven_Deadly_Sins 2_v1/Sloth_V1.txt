I need change yea I need change now
Too long being taking the pain route
Self inflicted I think bout it
Self inflicted I I think bout it
Why the fuck do I drink now
Future dusty can't paint clouds
Too many problems to take out
Too many problems to take out

I need change yea I need change now
Too long being taking the pain route
Self inflicted shit I think bout 
Self inflicted shit I think bout 
Why the fuck do I drink now
Future dusty can't paint clouds
Too many problems to take out
Too many problems to take out

Paralyzed in a sick trance
All eyes on sicophants 
Gimme something to sing and dance to
Intellectually realize you 
Gimme something I can work with
driving motive defining purpose
provide focus, I’ll find it worth it
otherwise, I comply to curses
Just want peace and next steps
Less effort and less checks
I'm just doing my best yea
I'm just doing my best yea
Sloth living out its best life
Better off in yo next life 
Check for progress u can check twice
I need yo perception to correct vices

Greed 

Money, money, money, money, yuh 
Esketit so its coming, yuh 
Proud owner of a thousand bitches 
Cash money pussy what a sound addition get the 
Money, money, money, money, yuh

Proud owner of a thousand bitches 
Cash money pussy what a sound addition chasing 
Money, money, money, money, yuh 
Esketit till its funny, yuh 
Steal a hoe with a Roley script it going holy shit you see its so efficient using
Money, money, money, money, yuh
Esketit just for plowing clits and i’m
Proud owner of a thousand bitches 
Cash money pussy what if I dismiss it

Id be broke and torn, smoking bored
Serotonin ain’t flowing for him
Prominent with my confidence
When im dominant with my spoken form
Get a crowd cause im better wild
and a fan base is where hope is formed 
so I tell myself that im better now
im made but but the rope is yours 
Most dudes waste it no surprize
Most who make it won’t survive
High’s and lows make a rollercoaster
Till the curtain close and the show is over
proaching sober but the pain is deep
stress is lower from inhaling weed
in a whole fuck breaking free then lose control cause im breaking me
want money green want all the smoke
think cunning greed haunts all who don’t
bad beats good as we’re torn to pieces
tho im sad we stood for the more for me shit
Why we here that more for Nietzsche
and I don’t rap just to warm the bleachers
and I don’t fuck with the nice to meet ya’s
and I don’t trust so I don’t feature, need the

(2nd Beat)

yuh, 

paranoid as they chase the check
rent is due I ain’t make it yet 
kick or sue what will thy chose
I claim its fair don’t give my view
Lil respect kept it low key, huh
would have made noise if you poked me, huh
If you know me know im broken hopeless yo my soul is open see my fears in motion,
I’ve been hurt before 
Think the pain was worth it
I been craving more 
I think the strain has surfaced 
Yo I came from poor
But my aim has swtiched
I’d envoke a war 
Cause I hate the rich
Greed I see as the greatest sin, 
See ya aimin up cause ya aim to win
Lost your way while chasing pride 
ask; which lil thing had to break inside
Empathy or a logic circuit 
if we questions methods then he probably purging 
no respecting lessons from illuminati
and no second guessing when im calmly certain 
that they got me working 
out of breath
I been hurting
needing rest
Im imperfect
feeling stressed
is it worth it 
speak in jest
Be the best 
Chase the check
World is yours \ you ain’t make it yet
Your in store cause the globe in warming
Like George Forman you been showed the warning 
We been burned before 
Guess the pain was worth it
See we craving more 
Think the strain has surfaced 
Yo we came for more
Think our strength’ll give
We creating war
Cause we hate to live
I’ve been hurt before 
Think the pain was worth it
I been craving more 
I think the strain has surfaced 
Yo I came from poor
But my aim has swtiched
I’d envoke a war 
Cause I hate the rich
Tunnel vision 
Power chasing 
Rapid growth
now were racing
Funnel funds
Tax evasion
Now were broke 
How to face it
Die or profit so values changed
I tried to stop it tho how you age
makes pride and logic show how you aim
decide an office so now you paid
Food and water have a lot to offer
suit and tie she hot an bothered
super fly went from rags to riches
to pursue the sky tryna bag some bitches
he insecure tho self aware 
but he got the wallet to drop a case 
he into her no one else’d care  
if he break the law and act out of place
She was hurt before 
Think the pain has worsened
He be craving more 
Think the strain has surfaced 
He came from rich
But his aim is pour
She broke and sick 
so she hate the rich
We been hurt before 
Think the pain has worsened
He been craving more
I think the strain has surfaced 
Yo we came for more
So our aim has swtiched
Wed envoke a war 
Cause we hate the rich
revolution for some better days 
evolution so we elevate
net solution lets get it eh
so we smoke the green and then meditate
hope is weak compared to truth
focused greed im scared of you
steal from those who support the system
but record the wisdom of a chosen few 
broken view, so specific
only chose what moves the mission
goal driven do what it takes 
soul missing you stuck in place 
fuck it takes till you see the flaws 
of what it takes when you be the boss
put pride aside can you see the cost
look eye to eye can you see whats off 
I’ve been hurt before 
Think the pain has worsened
I been craving more 
I think the strain has surfaced 
Yo I came from poor
But my aim has swtiched
I’d envoke a war 
Cause I hate the rich
I’ve been hurt before 
Think the pain has worsened
I been craving more 
I think the strain has surfaced 
Yo I came from poor
But my aim has swtiched
I’d envoke a war 
Cause I hate the rich

Wrath

I’ve been working hard 
Prides been there for me 
Ties have given scars 
I can’t care for speech  
If you thinkin im a star
then I think I left the weak
We a million miles apart 
You can send a check to me
You will give respect to me 
I’m goliath you are David 
What do you expect from me
if you tryna duel with Satan
I been salty to them all
specially those who hating
I been kicking tryna ball
Lifes a bitch you what you tasting 
I been itching for the fall
Im just missing how to face it 
Im upset n now in awe 
My unrest allowed impatience 
Im the best and yet I lost
I get scared when I get dropped 
not there up in his thoughts 
so I don’t care about him, nah
lying filled with hate 
hoping that it stop 
I disintegrate 
notice what it cost
Im just into fate
focus aim to odds 
righteousness the state which make me 
force this thing to pause, yuh
actions intersect so this fighters fina brawl and this
wrath is in effect so I might just hit em raw
so my  path is indirect and I just hit a wall,
im a fraction myself, there’s no passion living small 
I been active for the check check my status sitting tall
Im tryna find employment so im glad for getting calls
shit flashes McGrath I get bullied and its wrong 
just her power have me cowar its the bully and its mom
I been talking to myself just so I can get it gone
I been walking through my thoughts just to jot it in a song
You are like a loser father spin-off now get lost 
Know I don’t forget abusers pissed off then get soft 
The psychology of psychos
with apologies in cycles
but my weakness turn to fright so
I don’t give that bitch the time tho
she been keeping me afloat
knowing I don’t got a lifeboat 
tho I hate to hear her gloat
theres some things that I don’t fight no
like corrupted wicked souls
integrety thats fractured 
as sickness gets its tole
she don’t tend to see what matters
she a demon in a hole
no one keeping in control
keep a secret yo we hope 
that she weaken when she old
I been speaking with impatience but im feeling out of touch 
all I really gotta say is if she freak then I go nuts
I will feed her medications that I see and I don’t trust
with this bitchy manic patient I don’t feel and I don’t love
lying filled with hate 
hoping that it stop 
I disintegrate 
notice what it cost
Im just into fate
focus aim to odds 
righteousness the state which make me 
force this thing to pause, yuh (73)
lying filled with hate 
hoping that it stop 
I disintegrate 
notice what it cost
Im just into fate
focus aim to odds 
righteousness the state which make me 
force this thing to pause, yuh
questionin myself note my wrath is overactive cause of stress up in my cells cortisol from all who craft it like how mommy going batshit tho she blames it all on passion disrespect me while insain im in pains how I reacted
she’s proud when she’s decieptful and she’s right or shut the fuck up very loud can be unpeaceful maybe fight what you can muster its attention that she lust if she get it breaching trust or she get it speaking threats then she get it being fucked
using crazy as excuse but neglecting all the trauma
thinking maybe my abuse bring perspective to my momma
so decietful im confused ain’t expecting all the drama
getting manic then we panic im regressing in my karma
So I start with disrespecting cause i’ve really out of fucks
I don’t care for those inspecting cause their creepy out of touch
If you fuck with my relationship with Viv you out of luck
I got cases to restrain this shit for good im out of love, 
lying filled with hate 
hoping that it stop 
I disintegrate 
notice what it cost
Im just into fate
focus aim to odds 
righteousness the state which make me 
force this thing to pause, yuh (73)
lying filled with hate

Envy; Beat 1

why do I grind for the pay and fame
mind on the time I became insane  
tryna rise up while my age’ll change 
till i find my times up what the angels saying
denzel curry done made his name 
so I sit here worried cause my age the same
while the homie worked hard I was tamed in shame
by a broken ass school im decaying in pain
dream giving up but I still give a fuck tho im 80k in debt I don’t feel it enough I deny bright signs I admire my mind see satan take bets ima die via pride, huh
with my eyes quite wide quick slit wrists so my mind might die 
reincarnate restart eh retarded 
hungry eden just pick from the garden
im a mortal with portals to top tiers
and I been one its lit but exhausting
bitch you ain’t shit don’t know what it costing

one time for your mind
two time for the grind 
three times of till I die

Envy to my enemies who go for more 
Hate to the fields who have gamed the cheese

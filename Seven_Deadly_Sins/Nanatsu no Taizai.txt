Nanatsu no Taizai

Wake and bake im lazy need to take a break im crazy
Feeling wavy feeling gravy ouu there someone tryna hate me I been hating cause i’m waiting just to make it im impaciant feel the wrath of Liam McGrath i’m the captain feeling spacy I been told my crafts amazing 
like a path through heavens gates and whats inside my minds devine got the pride of several Lions met a girl she hot as fuck call it Lust I wanna bust we off to fuck 
she fall in love at dawn or dusk I gotta duck I make it home put on beat feeling tired I fall asleep and when I dream I often meet the prodigies I wanna beat gotta see  if possibly i’ll be getting some attention if I offer all of me 
will I prosper or receed to the thought of what could be tryna hack it as a rapper while i’m clashing with my greed will my passion gather me will my envy not get me am I lacking vanity can I have my wrath intact pull off an act and manage me

Minds have been distorted and of course its for the profit of a major corporation who just paid for who’s in office
i’ve been talking like prophet who was born in someones world tryna recreate the image we at war and with our words we can weaken the foundation of this place its so absurd so just face it were a herd unalert just what occured
thinkin bout it now we allowed this broken system
They engrained in everything can’t just take control and get em
they use dopamine to hold us down so hope and greed control us now and
coke and weed mean mo money the prison system hoards an hour
fuck this shit of course i’m sour freedom used to be the key
now it feels like all these pussy billionaires ain’t needing me 
If AI’s on the rise will the driving jobs survive 
If paydays will expire how am I to stay alive 
This question i’ve derived needs an answer truly soon
We should get our shit togerther if we can’t were truly doomed

Pride 

Yo, if anyone think their on this level, their not.

Seven deadly sins yet we win what the fucks up
Hard in the club don’t keep shit untucked 
Fun fuck end of the night like whats up
Live life fucked up feel quite untouched 
Test me fuckbois im activated 
Won’t breach the surface im passivated 
If you fucking with my clique you half a hater 
Cause these bitches on my dick you salivating, huh
Im past debating that you on my level 
bruh you masterbaiting im more like devil
cause I see she’s horny and she reaching for me
who am I to meddle, oh
Who am I to settle pride on my sign so I eye the kettle bruh im so impatient fuck being humble what an understatement but my vibe essential, huh 

Wonder what if I don fucked yo bitch
Prolly all the bros be like fuck yo sick
Prolly all the hoes won’t suck yo dick
That man trash no love no shit, huh
Wonder what if I don fucked yo bitch
Prolly all the bros be like fuck yo sick
Prolly all the hoes won’t suck yo dick
That man trash no love no shit, huh

“Purchase your tracks today”…but the money don’t make me hoes don’t change me 
Started at the bottom where the 4’s won’t date me 
Floor low state till I rose so greatly
Show more focus, yall so spacy
Childish whiling while im so shady
Vibing I been stuck eyeing diamonds
and my mind is silent cause the grind don’t phase me

Wonder what if I don fucked yo bitch
Prolly all the bros be like fuck yo sick
Prolly all the hoes won’t suck yo dick
That man trash no love no shit, huh

Im twice the man that you’ll ever be 
Dominance vice don’t pressure me
Confident talk real cleaverly
Living heavenly whatchu telling me
Im climbing higher so deny desires 
to explore ideas till yo mind is fire
What you admire what do I admire
Bitch thats the difference in our entropy
Essentially its meant to be
Im thinking that you missing this complexity
What you call boring likes sex to me
What you call a chore is like rest to me
Flex my logos don’t respect the weak
because I go so hard I get no rest or sleep
and if ima die via pride I know i’ll rest in peace
and if I admire my mind theres no regrets deceased, so

if ida gave a fuck bout these’s nutzo fuck hoes
ida played my way down like some gusto fuck bros
I been dangling the crown see yo lust go up tho
When im in a different crowd let the love go round
Let the sun go down when I duck my ego
I give up my pride when i consult my equals
I enclosed my mind when I confont the weak but
I provoke my kind if I withhold my speach so i’ve been 
hurt before, don’t think pain is worth it
tho we go for gold no ones aim is perfect
I been tainted, burned I see the strain is surfaced 
now im anxious hurting fuck I hate this earth its 
like a living hell are you feeling will
can you even tell I think I need a purpose 
and for me to sell need to be immersive
pride on my sign bitches read the cursive, easy
